`-u`, `--update` | When copying files from one directory to another, only copy files that either don’t exist or are newer than the existing corresponding files in the destination directory. This is useful when copying large numbers of files as it skips files that don’t need to be copied
`-v`, `--verbose` | Display informative messages as the copy is performed.

---

- `rm file` : remove files and directories


Option | Meaning

10.1 ‘ls’: List directory contents
==================================

The ‘ls’ program lists information about files (of any type, including
directories).  Options and file arguments can be intermixed arbitrarily,
as usual.

   For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by
default ‘ls’ lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and
omitting files with names beginning with ‘.’.  For other non-option
arguments, by default ‘ls’ lists just the file name.  If no non-option
argument is specified, ‘ls’ operates on the current directory, acting as
if it had been invoked with a single argument of ‘.’.

   By default, the output is sorted alphabetically, according to the
locale settings in effect.(1)  If standard output is a terminal, the
output is in columns (sorted vertically) and control characters are
output as question marks; otherwise, the output is listed one per line
and control characters are output as-is.

- Quoting:
    - Double Quotes: If we place text inside double quotes, all the special characters used by the shell lose their special meaning and are treated as ordinary characters. The exceptions are $ (dollar sign), \ (backslash), and ` (backtick).
    - Single Quotes: If we need to suppress all expansions, we use single quotes.
- Escaping Characters:
    - `\` : is used for escaping
- Backslash Escape Situation:

Escape Sequence | Meaning
--- | ---
`\a` | Bell (an alert that causes the computer to beep)
`\b` | Backspace
`\n` | Newline; on Unix-like systems, this produces a line feed
`\r` | Carriage return
`\t` | tab

Notation | Meaning
--- | ---
`u+x` | Add execute permission for the owner.
`u-x` | Remove execute permission from the owner.
`+x` | Add execute permission for the owner, group, and world. This is equivalent to a+x.
`o-rw` | Remove the read and write permissions from anyone besides the owner and group owner.
`go=rw` | Set the group owner and anyone besides the owner to have read and write permissions. If either the group owner or the world previously had execute permission, it is removed.

Transporting Files over a Network
    
- `ftp` : `ftp` is used to communicate with FTP servers, machines that contain files that can be uploaded and downloaded over a network. `FTP` (in its original form) is not secure because it sends account names and passwords in cleartext.

```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ ftp fileserver
Connected to fileserver.localdomain.
220 (vsFTPd 2.0.1)
Name (fileserver:me): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> cd pub/cd_images/ubuntu-18.04
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-rw-r--    1 500      500      733079552 Apr 25 03:53 ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> lcd Desktop
Local directory now /home/me/Desktop
ftp> get ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso
local: ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso remote: ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for ubuntu-18.04-desktop-amd64.iso (733079552 bytes).
226 File send OK.

ftp> bye
```

Command | Meaning
--- | ---
`ftp fileserver` | Invoke the `ftp` program and have it connect the FTP server `fileserver`
`anonymous` | Login name. After the login prompt, a password prompt will appear. Some servers will accept a blank password; others will require a password in the form of an email address. In that case, try something like user@example.
`cd` | change directory
`ls` | list directory
`lcd Desktop` | Change the directory on the local system to ~/Desktop. In the example, the ftp program was invoked when the working directory was ~. This command changes the working directory to ~/Desktop.
`get` | transfer file from remote server to local system
`bye` | Log off the remote server and end the ftp program session. The commands quit and exit may also be used.

- `lftp` is a Better ftp

---

- `wget` : It is useful for downloading content from both web and FTP sites. Single files, multiple files, and even entire sites can be downloaded. 

```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ wget http://linuxcommand.org/index.php
--11:02:51--  http://linuxcommand.org/index.php
           => `index.php'

- `ssh` : SSH solves the two basic problems of secure communication with a remote host.
    - It authenticates that the remote host is who it says it is (thus preventing so-called man-in-the-middle attacks).
    - It encrypts all of the communications between the local and remote hosts.
    - `ssh remote-sys` : To connect to a remote host named remote-sys
    - `ssh username@remote-sys` : login with specific username
    - `ssh remote-sys <command>`: to execute just a single command



```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ ssh remote-sys
The authenticity of host 'remote-sys (192.168.1.4)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 41:ed:7a:df:23:19:bf:3c:a5:17:bc:61:b3:7f:d9:bb.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

- `scp` - (secure copy). copy files from local host to remote host

```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ scp remote-sys:document.txt .
me@remote-sys's password:

[me@linuxbox ~]$
```

- `sftp` : SSH file-copying program

```
[me@linuxbox ~]$ sftp remote-sys
Connecting to remote-sys...
me@remote-sys's password:
sftp> ls
ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso
sftp> lcd Desktop

- `locate` : Find files by name
- `find` : Search for files in a directory hierarchy
- `xargs ` : Build and execute command lines from standard input
- `touch` : Change file times
- `stat`: Display file or file system status

---

- `find` : find files the hard way
    - `find ~` : to produce a listing of our home directory
    - `find ~ | wc -l` : to count the number of files.
    - `find ~ -type d | wc -l` : `-type d` limit the search to directories
    - `find ~ -type f | wc -l` : `-type f` limit the search to regular files 
    - `find ~ -type f -name "*.JPG" -size +1M | wc -l`: all the regular files that match the wildcard pattern *.JPG and are larger than one megabyte

File type | Description
--- | ---
`b` | Block special device file
`c` | Character special device file
`d` | Directory
`f` | Regular file
`l` | Symbolic link


- find size units

Character | Unit
--- | ---
`b` | 512-byte blocks. This is default if no unit is specified.
`c` | Bytes
`w` | 2-byte words
`k` | Kilobytes (units of 1,024 bytes)
`M` | Megabytes (units of 1,048,576 bytes)
`c` | Gigabytes (units of 1,073,741,824 bytes)

- `xargs` -  It accepts input from standard input and converts it into an argument list for a specified command

```
find ~ -type f -name 'foo*' -print | xargs ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 me   me 224 2007-10-29 18:44 /home/me/bin/foo
